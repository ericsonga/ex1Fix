Example 3: Find the Average of a List of Values
--------------------------------------------------
      
Another common thing to do with a list of values is find the average.  To do this create a variable to hold the sum and initialize it to 0.  Then loop through all the indices in the list and add the value at the current index to the sum.  Remember that you can't divide by 0, so if the length of the list is 0 then return 0, otherwise return the sum divided by the number of items in the list (the length of the list). 

Examples
========

For example ``getAverage([50,60,70])`` should return 60 and ``getAverage([])`` should return 0.

Run Code
=========

Click the |runbutton| button to run the tests that check that this code is working correctly.  All tests should print |pass| since this is correct code.  Scroll down to try to solve the practice problem below.

.. activecode:: Get_Average
   :nocodelens:

   # define the function
   def getAverage(numList):
   
       # init sum 
       sum = 0  
      
       # loop through indicies
       for index in range(len(numList)):
       
           # get value at index
           value = numList[index]
      
           # add value to sum
           sum = sum + value
    
       # prevent a divide by zero
       if len(numList) == 0:
             return 0 
             
       # return the average
       return sum / len(numList)

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

       def testOne(self):
           self.assertEqual(getAverage([50,60,70]),60.0, "Test of getAverage[50,60,70])");
           self.assertEqual(getAverage([]),0, "Test of getAverage([])");
           self.assertEqual(getAverage([75,60,80,95]),77.5, "Test of getAverage([75,60,80,95])");
           self.assertEqual(getAverage([10,20,30,40,90]),38.0, "Test of getAverage([10,20,30,40,90])");
           self.assertEqual(getAverage([4]),4.0, "Test of getAverage([4])");

Practice 3: Find the Average Dropping the Lowest Value
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following code should find the average of a list of numbers except for the lowest value, but it contains errors.  To find the average of all but the lowest value first check if the length of the list is less than or equal to one and if so return 0 to prevent a divide by zero error.  Otherwise create a variable to hold the sum and initialize it to 0. Create another variable to hold the lowest value found so far and initialize it to the first value in the list. Next loop through all the indices in the list and add the value at the current index to the sum.  Also check if the current value is less than the saved lowest value found so far and if it is set the lowest value to the current value.  Return the sum minus the lowest value divided by the number of values in the list minus one.

.. note ::
   
    Remember that you should set the initial lowest to the first value that you are processing, not zero.  
    
Examples
========

For example ``getAverageDropLowest([50,10,50])`` should return 50 since dropping the lowest value (10) results in a sum of 100 and dividing 100 by 2 yields 50.  The call ``getAverageDropLowest([10])`` should return 0 since there is only one value in the list.
